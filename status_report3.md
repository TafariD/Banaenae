#Status Report 2 - April 24th

###What we have accomplished this week:
* Created responsive Upvote buttons setting upvoted and downvoted attributes html tags
* Scraper re-written in JS with cheerio
* Fleshed out mongoose fooditem schema
* Set up node-schedule to scrap daily

###Challenges and issues we have faced
* Again, we have not been able to meet as an entire team, but we have worked individually and have set goals
* We faced a strange bug while trying to get modules to export properly, turned out to be a naming issue

### Goals for the next week
* finish scrape.js module, and push to heroku for test drive
* separate alltime, daily etc, lets make use of the schema we designed

### Long term goals, putting things into perspective...
* We have definitely passed all the hard implementation, lets get together and plan elavator pitch for the app
