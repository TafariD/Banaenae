#FOODBACK

###The Problem
* Tuft's dining needs a better way to receive feedback and suggestions for their menu.

###The Solutions
* We offer a web and mobile site that compiles Tuft's dining hall menus and lets students up and down items on the menu (similar to Yik-Yak's interface).  Our site will also provide a section for users to provide their own suggestions, which can then be up and down voted.  
* Our up and down vote system will provide data on what items are popular or unpopular, and thus should be offered more or less often.  It also gives   	students an easy way to give recommendations

###Features:
* Main page refreshed daily that lists all items available for the day using up and down vote system
* All-time page that lists all-time popular daily items based on cumulative number of upvotes from daily section
* User suggestions section featuring food item recommendations written by users using up and down vote system
* Server-side persistent data that is the storage of rankings from up and down votes.  Also stores user's favorite foods based on foods they have 			upvoted multiple times.
* Front-end framework
* Graphs and charts available as a tool to analyze rankings
* Email/push notifications when your suggestions receive upvotes and when your favorite food will be offered

###Data
* Server-side persistent data that is the storage of rankings from up and down votes.  Also stores user's favorite foods based on foods they have 			upvoted multiple times.

###Algorithms
* We will formulate an algorithm that determines the time-frame for which user suggestions remain visible in their section
