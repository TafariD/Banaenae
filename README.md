#FOODBACK

###The Problem
* Tuft's dining needs a better way to receive feedback and suggestions for their menu.

###The Solution
* A site that compiles Tuft's dining hall menus and lets students up and down vote items on the menu (similar to Yik-Yak's interface). The site will also provide a section for users to provide their own suggestions, which can then be up and down voted.  

###Features:
* Server-side persistent data that is the storage of rankings from up and down votes.  Also stores user's favorite foods based on foods they have 			upvoted multiple times.
* Front-end framework
* Graphs and charts available as a tool to analyze rankings
* Email/push notifications when your suggestions receive upvotes and when your favorite food will be offered
* Geolocation
* Main page refreshed daily that lists all items available for the day using up and down vote system
* All-time page that lists all-time popular daily items based on cumulative number of upvotes from daily section
* User suggestions section featuring food item recommendations written by users using up and down vote system

###Data
* Server-side persistent data that is the storage of rankings from up and down votes.  Also stores user's favorite foods based on foods they have 			upvoted multiple times.

###Algorithms
* We will formulate an algorithm that determines the time-frame that user suggestions will remain visible in their section
