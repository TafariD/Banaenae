#FOODBACK

###The Problem
* Tuft's dining needs a better way to receive feedback and suggestions for their menu.

###The Solutions
* We offer a web and mobile site that compiles Tuft's dining hall menus and lets students up and down items on the menu (similar to Yik-Yak's interface).  Our site will also provide a section for users to provide their own suggestions, which can then be up and down voted.
